      Hi there! 👋🏻
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are here you probably want to learn more about me.
      I earn my living by writing code and dealing with all sorts of data related technologies.
      If this is why you're here you can poke around my <a href="http://github.com/irdvl/">github</a> account,
      check out my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/ivanrudovol/">linkedin</a> or take a look at my 
      <a href="https://github.com/irdvl/resume/blob/master/ivan_rudovol_resume.pdf">resume</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p>Outside of work I am passionate about music and photography. 
      Architectural photography is one of my favorite subjects, you can check out a few photos I took on my <a href="https://instagram.com/irdvl">instagram</a>.
      I also used to DJ and <a href="http://itsjet.club/">throw parties</a> with a few friends when I lived in Seattle. You can still listen to a few mixes on my <a href="http://soundcloud.com/irdvl">soundcloud</a>.
